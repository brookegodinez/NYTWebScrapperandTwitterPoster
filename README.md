# NYTWebScrapperandTwitterPoster
Web scraper in python using selenium that would post nyt articles to my twitter.
This is a very simple webscrapper that will scrap the front page article URLS off of the nytimes.com site. It will then post these to my blank twitter. 
In the future this scraper could be made more advanced or complicated.
